Our project mainly focusses on making voting process easier and more accessible for electors. Through our project we will be giving voters the opportunity to vote at any time and anywhere before the deadline. We will be implementing the internet voting in our project using blockchain. The three pillars of our project would be transparency(the voter's identity would be hidden by complex cryptography and represented by their public id's), security(which will be ensured by cryptographic hashing) and immutability(the vote can be casted and changed as many times as possible before the deadline, but once it the deadline is over, the already casted votes cannot be tampered with). We will be creating a blockchain of all the constituencies in a country(say India). each block of constituency will have it's specific party and representative cadidate of the party. Whosoever has to vote, will cast a vote to a particular party in their constituency. In the end the party which will get maximum number of votes from the constituency will be the winner. This way the traditional form of voting would be preserved and it would be less expensive and there'd be no ballot errors.
